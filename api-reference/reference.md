## API Reference 

Compass can be thought as a [Daemon process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) which runs without interaction after its initated. Due to this there is no externally facing APIs for external software to interact with. 

Check out the [setup guide](quick-start/setup-guide.md) to understand how to use this software.
